## Simple web blogging platform

4) yarn install (or npm install)
5) yarn run production (or npm run production)
6) cp .env.example .env (update .env with the right database credentials and email settings to use the reset password feature)
7) php artisan migrate
8) php artisan db:seed
9) Set up de codebase in a virtual host (apache, nginx, etc) or run php artisan serve

NOTES
a) Credentials of two default admin users are in: database/seeds/UsersTableSeeder.php
b) Command to import posts from "https://sq1-api-test.herokuapp.com/posts" can be executed automatically (every hour), creating a cron job (set up to run evey minute) and add this settings:
		* * * * * cd /path-to-your-PROJECT_NAME && php artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
		(Refer to https://laravel.com/docs/6.x/scheduling)
c) Command to import posts also can be executed manually when it's needed:
	- php artisan import:posts
d) Different sources of imported posts can be added to the command. The default one is source=api_rest. It's just needed to create a new class that implements App\Import\Importer and update the factory class App\Import\Post\StaticFactory. See App\Import\Post\ApiRestImporter as an example.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.
